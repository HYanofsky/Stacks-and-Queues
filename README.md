This code uses an absract classs called SimpleList to implements stacks and queues in a singly linked list.

The program should ask the user for the name of an input text file and an output text file. The input file will contain a list of commands, one per line. Each command will direct the program to create a stack or a queue, to push a value onto a stack or a queue, or to pop a value from a stack or a queue. The program will read and process the commands in the text file.

Compile:
g++ Code.cpp
./a.exe
Write in the name of the file it is reading from and writing to as promted.
